    "\n",
    "**BUSINESS AND DATA UNDERSTANDING**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Project Structure and Description**\n",
    "\n",
    "The telecommunication industry is fiercely competitive, with companies striving to capture and retain customer loyalty. One major challenge they face is customer churn, which is the rate at which customers discontinue their services and move to competitors. Customer churn can significantly affect a company's revenue and profitability, as acquiring new customers is generally more expensive than keeping existing ones. To tackle this issue in this project, I aim to build a classification model to analyze customer churn for a company. By understanding the factors influencing customer churn, the company can implement strategies to improve customer retention and increase profit margins. The project follows the CRISP-DM methodology to ensure a structured and thorough approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Business Goals and Objective**\n",
    "\n",
    "The main goal of this churn analysis project is to assist the telecommunication company in reducing customer churn and improving customer retention through data-driven insights and predictive modeling, ultimately leading to increased revenue and profitability.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem Statement**\n",
    "The telecommunication company is experiencing a significant rate of customer churn, which negatively impacts its revenue and profitability. Despite efforts to retain customers, the company lacks a comprehensive understanding of the factors driving churn and the effectiveness of current retention strategies. This project aims to identify the key drivers of customer churn and develop predictive models to forecast churn risk, enabling the company to implement targeted interventions to retain customers and improve overall business performance.\n",

Use clustering techniques to group customers based on their usage patterns and then analyze churn rates within these clusters. Compare the results across different demographic segments to uncover unique patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "6.\tWhat role do payment methods and billing preferences play in customer churn, and which specific methods/preferences are associated with higher retention rates?\n",
    "Analyze churn rates across different payment methods and billing preferences.

Investigate customer feedback to understand the underlying reasons for these associations.\n",
    "\n",
    "7.\tWhat is the effect of customer service interactions on churn, and how do these effects vary by customer segment (e.g., senior citizens, customers with high monthly charges)?\n",
    "\n",
    "Evaluate the impact of customer service interactions on churn by analyzing customer service logs, feedback, and churn data.
